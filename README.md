I'm an IT student who lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm learning how to code. I'm having fun making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future).  

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
