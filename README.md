I'm an IT student who lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm learning how to code. I'm having fun making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future).  

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, SASS, Python, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to program.
- 👌 I recommend using the Jet Brains Mono font for coding, its perfect. <a href= "https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/lp/mono/">link</a>
- 😀 I like to code, read, learn about computers and crypto currencies.
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you want.
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are only 10 types of people in the world – those who understand binary, and those who don’t.
